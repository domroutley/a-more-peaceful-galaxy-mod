# A more peaceful galaxy mod

## Mod description
This mod changes the spawn mechanics for AI empires to make the likelihood of "aggressive" (see technical description) AI spawning a lot lower than in vanilla.  
This is intended to enable two different styles of gameplay:

1. "I just want to nation build".  
My personal use case, this is for those players who want to just build a big empire and not have to fight wars to maintain it. A much more peaceful playstyle. Note; this only lowers the ratio of "aggressive" to "non-aggressive" AI empires, it does NOT remove them entirely from the game.

1. "I want to crush the entire galaxy under my boot".  
As there are much fewer "aggressive" AI, you will have less competition to take over the galaxy. Maybe mix with a "no federations allowed" mod for an even easier play through.
